# Computational Cultural Publishing: A Sprint on COVID-19

## Demand 100% open research now!

An online sprint / workshop to place as part of 'AMRO 20 – Of Whirlpools and Tornadoes' based in the city of Linz, Austria. 20-23 May 2020 - Art Meets Radical Openness https://www.radical-openness.org/en

Questions DM @mrchristian99

**Your invited to ask questions about what the open scientific literature knows about COVID-19 using openVirus**

The topic to put into the sprint is to be able to ask questions of the open scientific literature on COVID-19. There is an open-source project doing data-mining and campaigning for 100% open research for the pandemic. We can ask questions and they can mine existing literature using WikiData terms. openVirus is an open research group of researchers and activists https://github.com/petermr/openVirus

 1. We can create responses, visualisations on the answers to questions we ask
 2. We can comment, make demand of the scientific community 
 3. Here is an example of someone doing data science and COVID-19 https://ncase.me/covid-19/ I don’t mean for us to do something so explanatory more that you can combine text and simulations.

So what's 'cultural computational publishing and the sprint or book sprint'. 

 1. The sprint or book sprint is just an arbitrary time constraint to get people together to author on a topic. But we acknowledge that there is a deep asynchronous labor and expert part of publishing which is the feminized labor (less valued) of adding in detail and getting things right. 
 2. ‘Cultural computational publishing' that’s a mixture of Jupyter Notebook and Book, community owned publications like [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/introduction/introduction.html) - which include live code in the publication, and 'computational publishing' which essentially means wrapping up all material in a reproducible environment see: https://research-compendium.science/
 
## What will be produced

 - A Jupyter Books collaboratively made publication includeing openNotebook logs 
 - A record of searches made using openVirus and ContentMine
 - A Wikiversity preprint and open Notebook contribution, that is open before and after the workshop and is collaboratively authored. https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/WikiJournal_Preprints/Cultural_Computational_Publishing:_A_Sprint
